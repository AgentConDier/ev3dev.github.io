================

This is the web page at <http://www.ev3dev.org> and also <http://ev3dev.github.io>.

Feel free to fork and make a pull request. 

When forking, you can create a new branch called `gh-pages`, then your changes can be
viewed as `http://<user>.github.io/ev3dev.github.io`. When you do this though,
GitHub will send you lots of email like this, which you should ignore.

If it really gets on your nerves, you can rename the `CNAME` file. Just make sure to
change it back before you submit your pull request.
