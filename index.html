          If you are like us, you have probably found that while the software that
          comes with the EV3 is great, it just doesn't do everything you would
          like it to.
      </p>
      <p>
          We have rebuilt much of the software for the EV3 from the ground up. We have
          created our own hardware drivers that expose all the EV3 functionality that
          you know and love to empower you to build great robots and write amazing code.

            ev3dev gives you the power to program how <i>you</i> want to. It is as easy
            as reading from and writing to a file, so every programming language that
            supports Linux will work with your EV3 and its devices.

        <p>
            ev3dev is, at its core, Debian Linux. All Linux software and features work
            flawlessly with ev3dev, allowing your apps to interact with USB peripherals 
            and EV3 gadgets seamlessly.

        <p>
            ev3dev runs from the microSD slot on the EV3. It doesn't touch the stock EV3
            OS, so just unplug the SD card to get back to the LEGO environment. Getting
            up-and-running takes only minutes, and we have guides to lead you along the
            way.

            First, you need to download and install the latest image file on a microSD card.
            Check out the [Getting Started] page for step-by-step instructions. Or, if you
            are not using ev3dev with an EV3, check out the [DKMS driver package][DKMS].

            Then, you can write a program however you like. You can use just about anything
            with a SSH client - Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, iOS, Blackberry, etc. The
            [docs] page has information about how to use the drivers and has links to
            libraries contributed by users for some programming languages.

            If you need some ideas, check out the projects on our [Share] page. If you get
            stuck, check out the [Get Help] page.
