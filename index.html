          If you are like us, you have probably found that while the software that
          comes with the EV3 is great, it just doesn't do everything you would
          like it to.
      </p>
      <p>
          We have rebuilt much of the software for the EV3 from the ground up. We have
          created our own hardware drivers that expose all the EV3 functionality that
          you know and love to empower you to build amazing robots and write great code.

            <p>
                ev3dev gives you the power to program how <i>you</i> want to. It is as easy
                as reading from and writing to a file, so every programming language that
                supports Linux will work with your EV3 and its devices.
            </p>
            <p>
                ev3dev supports many popular scripting languages out-of-the-box, so you can
                get started right away.

            </h2>
            <p>
                ev3dev is, at its core, Debian Linux. All Linux software and features work
                flawlessly with ev3dev, allowing your apps to interact with USB peripherals
                and EV3 gadgets seamlessly.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the software that you want isn't preinstalled, use standard <code>apt</code>
                tools to get what you need.

            </h2>
            <p>
                ev3dev runs from the microSD slot on the EV3. It doesn't touch the stock EV3
                OS, so just unplug the SD card to get back to the LEGO environment. Getting
                up-and-running takes only minutes, and we have guides to lead you along the
                way.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even if you decide not to keep using it, installing ev3dev can be an easy and
                painless way to learn more about Linux. ev3dev is a small, sandboxed Linux
                machine that you can do whatever you want with.
