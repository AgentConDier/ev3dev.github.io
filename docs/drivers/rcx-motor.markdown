title: RCX/Power Functions Motor Driver
---

This driver provides a [dc-motor] interface for RCX motors, Power Functions
motors or any other 9V rated DC motor connected to an output port. You can
find the sysfs device at `/sys/bus/legoev3/devices/<port>:rcx-motor` where
`<port>` is the the name of the output port the motor is connected to (e.g.
`outA`). There is not much of interest there though - all the useful stuff
is in the [dc-motor] class.

This device is loaded when an [ev3-output-port] is set to `rcx-motor` mode.
It is not automatically detected.

[dc-motor]: ../dc-motor-class
[ev3-output-port]: ../ev3-output-port
