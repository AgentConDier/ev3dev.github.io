title: NXT Analog Sensor Driver
---

The `nxt-analog-sensor` module provides all of the drivers for Analog/NXT
sensors. You can find the complete list [here][supported sensors].

### sysfs Attributes

These drivers provide a [msensor device], which is where all the really
useful attributes are.

You can find this device at `/sys/bus/legoev3/devices/in<N>:<device-name>`
where `<N>` is the number of an input port (1 to 4) and `<device-name>` is
the name of one of the drivers in the `nxt-analog-sensor` module (e.g.
`lego-nxt-sound`). NOTE: These drivers are also used by the [HiTechnic NXT
Sensor Multiplexer], in which case the device name will be
`in<N>:mux<M>:nxt-analog-host`.

`device_type` (read-only)
: Returns `nxt-analog-sensor`

`port_name` (read-only)
: Returns the name of the port this host is connected to (e.g. `in1`).

[msensor device]: ../msensor-class
[supported sensors]: ../#supported-sensors
