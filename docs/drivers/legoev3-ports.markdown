title: EV3 Input and Output Ports
---

By default, a sysfs device is created for each input and output port on the
EV3. See the [ev3-input-port] and [ev3-output-port] drivers for more
information on how these work.

### Module parameters

`disable_in_port`
: Used to prevent the input port device from being loaded. This is useful
if you want to use input port 1 for printing kernel messages while you
are debugging the Linux kernel. You may also want to do this if you want
to control the input port gpios directly.

`disable_out_port`
: Used to prevent the output port from being loaded. This leaves the pwm
device and gpios used by the port free to be controlled directly or used
by other drivers.
