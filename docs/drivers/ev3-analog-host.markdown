title: EV3 Analog Host Driver
---

This driver tells an [EV3 input port] to configure itself for Analog/EV3
communications and loads a sensor device based on the id resistor of the
sensor that is connected to the port.

### sysfs Attributes

* You can find this device at `/sys/bus/legoev3/devices/in<N>:ev3-analog-host`
where `<N>` is the number of an input port (1 to 4).

`device_type` (read-only)
: Returns `ev3-analog-host`

`port_name` (read-only)
: Returns the name of the port this host is connected to (e.g. `in1`).

[EV3 input port]: ../ev3-input-port
