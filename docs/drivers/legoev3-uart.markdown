title: EV3 UART Line Discipline
---

This driver is a tty [line discipline] that runs on top of a tty. It listens
for the information data that is sent from UART/EV3 sensors. When it receives
valid data, it negotiates with the sensor, telling the sensor to enter data
sending mode. After successful negotiation, it creates an [msensor device]
that is used to monitor and control the sensor.

This line discipline has been assigned the number 29. To attach this line
discipline to a tty, run `ldattach 29 /dev/tty<N>` where `<N>` is the name
of the tty you want to connect to.  **NOTE:** This driver [works with any tty],
which means the sensor does not necessarily have to be plugged into one of
the input ports on the EV3.

UART/EV3 sensors do not have individual drivers like other types of sensors.
As a result, the name returned by the [msensor][msensor device] `name`
attribute is not a real driver name. Instead it returns `ev3-uart-<N>`,
where `<N>` is the type id of the sensor.
