title: DC Motor Class
---

The `dc-motor` class provides a uniform interface for using regular DC motors
with no fancy controls or feedback. This includes LEGO MINDSTORMS RCX motors
and LEGO Power Functions motors.

### sysfs Attributes

DC motors can be found at `/sys/class/dc-motor/motor<N>`, where `<N>`
is incremented each time a motor is loaded (it is not related to which port
the motor is plugged in to).

`command` (read/write)
: Sets the command for the motor. Possible values are `run`, `brake` and
`coast`. Not all commands may be supported, so be sure to check the contents
of the `commands` attribute.

`commands` (read-only)
: Returns a space separated list of commands supported by the motor
controller.

`driver_name` (read-only)
: Returns the name of the motor driver that loaded this device. See the list
of [supported devices] for a list of drivers.

`duty_cycle` (read)
: Shows the current duty cycle of the PWM signal sent to the motor. Values
are -100 to 100 (-100% to 100%).

`duty_cycle_sp` (read/write)
: Writing sets the duty cycle setpoint of the PWM signal sent to the motor.
Valid values are -100 to 100 (-100% to 100%). Reading returns the current
setpoint.

`polarity`: (read/write)
: Sets the polarity of the motor. Valid values are `normal` and `inverted`.

`port_name` (read-only)
: Returns the name of the port that the motor is connected to.

`ramp_down_ms` (read/write)
: Sets the time in milliseconds that it take the motor to ramp down from 100%
to 0%. Valid values are 0 to 10000 (10 seconds). Default is 0. If the
controller does not support ramping, then reading and writing will fail
with -EOPNOTSUPP.

`ramp_up_ms` (read/write)
: Sets the time in milliseconds that it take the motor to up ramp from 0% to
100%. Valid values are 0 to 10000 (10 seconds). Default is 0. If the
controller does not support ramping, then reading and writing will fail
with -EOPNOTSUPP.
