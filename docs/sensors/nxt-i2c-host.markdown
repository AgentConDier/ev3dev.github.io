title: NXT I2C Host Driver
---

This driver tells an [EV3 input port] to configure itself for I2C
communications (same for both I2C/NXT and I2C/Other). This includes
registering an I2C adapter for the port. The adapter can be found at
`/sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-<N>`, where `<N>` is the number of the input
port plus 2 (3 to 6).[^i2c-adapter-numbering] More likely, you will be
interested in the device node which is `/dev/i2c-in<N>`, where `<N>` is
the number of the EV3 input port.[^i2c-device-node-symlinks]

Unlike the analog host drivers, this host does not have anything to do with
the [I2C sensor drivers]. The I2C sensor drivers are proper Linux I2C
drivers and I2C client devices are loaded by the I2C adapter driver. See
[Using I2C Sensors].

### sysfs Attributes

* You can find this device at `/sys/bus/legoev3/devices/in<N>:nxt-i2c-host`
where `<N>` is the number of an input port (1 to 4).

`device_type` (read-only)
: Returns `ev3-analog-host`

`port_name` (read-only)
: Returns the name of the port this host is connected to (e.g. `in1`).

<hr />

[^i2c-adapter-numbering]: The reason for the offset is because the CPU has
    two built-in I2C ports that take the numbers 0 and 1.

[^i2c-device-node-symlinks]: `/dev/i2c-in<N>` is a symlink to `/dev/i2c-<N+2>`

[EV3 input port]: ../ev3-input-port
[I2C sensor drivers]: ../nxt-i2c-sensor
