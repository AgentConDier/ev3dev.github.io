title: I2C Sensor Addressing
---

I2C uses a 7-bit addressing scheme (there is also 10-bit addressing but it is
not implemented in the ev3dev I2C driver). When sending an address over the bus,
the address is shifted to the left 1 bit and the least significant bit is used
to indicate read or write. It is important to know this because LEGO and other
3rd-party sensor manufacturers use the shifted value as the address in their
documentation. This shifted value is also used in most other NXT/EV3
programming languages/environments.

ev3dev uses the standard Linux kernel convention, which is to use the unshifted
value as the I2C address. **This means the address in your sensors' documentation
is probably not the address that you need for ev3dev!** Also, depending on the
tool, the address may need to be decimal instead of hexidecimal. This means you
will have to convert the value to get the correct address. Shift to the right
is the same as divide by 2, so get out your calculator and do some conversions!
Or for the engineer type folks that prefer tables... see below.


I2C addresses 0x01 through 0x07 (unshifted) are reserved
for special use by the I2C specifications. However, these addresses are used by
some sensors anyway (most notably the NXT Ultrasonic sensor). The ev3dev kernel
has been patched to allow these to work, but some userspace tools will not work
with devices at these addresses. For example, we distribute a patched version
of the `i2c-tools` package to work around this.
