title: NXT Analog Host Driver
---

This driver tells an [EV3 input port] to configure itself for Analog/NXT
communications. If the auto-detection algorithm was able to determine the
exact type of sensor, that sensor driver is loaded, otherwise the generic
[nxt-analog] sensor driver is loaded. You can set the correct driver for
the attached sensor using the `set_sensor` attribute (see below).

### sysfs Attributes

You can find this device at `/sys/bus/legoev3/devices/in<N>:nxt-analog-host`
where `<N>` is the number of an input port (1 to 4). NOTE: This host is also
used by the [HiTechnic NXT Sensor Multiplexer], in which case the device
name will be `in<N>:mux<M>:nxt-analog-host`.

`device_type` (read-only)
: Returns `nxt-analog-host`

`port_name` (read-only)
: Returns the name of the port this host is connected to (e.g. `in1`).

`set_sensor` (write-only)
: Writing the name of the sensor driver will remove the existing device from
this host and load a new sysfs device for the sensor specified. The name
of the sensor is one of the drivers in the [nxt-analog-sensor] module from
the [list of supported sensors] (e.g. `lego-nxt-sound`). In other words,
only sensors with connection type of Analog/NXT work with the
`nxt-analog-host`. A space separated list of valid sensor names can be
obtained by reading `/sys/bus/legoev3/drivers/nxt-analog-sensor/sensor_names`.
