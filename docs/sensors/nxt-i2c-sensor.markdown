title: NXT I2C Sensor Driver
---

The `nxt-i2c-sensor` module provides all of the drivers for I2C/NXT
sensors. You can find the complete list [here][supported sensors].

### sysfs Attributes

These drivers provide a [msensor device], which is where all the really
useful attributes are.

You can find this device at `/sys/bus/legoev3/devices/in<N>:<device-name>`
where `<N>` is the number of an input port (1 to 4) and `<device-name>` is
the name of one of the drivers in the `nxt-analog-sensor` module (e.g.
`lego-nxt-sound`).

`device_type` (read-only)
: Returns `nxt-i2c-sensor`

`port_name` (read-only)
: Returns the name of the port this host is connected to (e.g. `in1`).

### Module Parameters

Note: These parameters can be changed at runtime at
`/sys/module/nxt_i2c_sensor/parameters/<parameter>`.

`allow_autodetect`
: Setting to `N` disables probing of sensors. Default is `Y`.

`default_poll_ms`
: This provides the default value for the poll_ms attribute. A value of `0`
    will disable polling by default. Values of less that the minimum 50
    msec will be rounded up to 50 msec. Changes only affect sensors plugged
    in after the change was made. Default is 100 msec.
