title: EV3 UART Host Driver
---

This driver tells an [EV3 input port] to configure itself for UART
communications. It also triggers a udev rule that loads the [EV3 UART Sensor
Line Discipline] on the tty device associated with the port.

You can find this device at `/sys/bus/legoev3/devices/in<N>:ev3-uart-host`
where `<N>` is the number of an input port (1 to 4).

### sysfs Attributes

`device_type` (read-only)
: Returns `ev3-uart-host`

`port_name` (read-only)
: Returns the name of the port this host is connected to (e.g. `in1`).

[EV3 input port]: ../ev3-input-port
[EV3 UART Sensor Line Discipline]: ../legoev3-uart
