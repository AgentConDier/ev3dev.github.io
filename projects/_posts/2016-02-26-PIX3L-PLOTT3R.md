excerpt: "This is a dot matrix printing robot made with a LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3. It accepts any image file." 
---

This is a dot matrix printing robot that will accept any image file (including jpeg and png). Images around 80 pixels width look the best. At the moment, images that are RGB, and B&W can be automatically processed by the code. The printer is approximately the size of a US Letter paper (8.5"W X 11"H). The project page will be updated as additional features are added.
