excerpt: "This is a dot matrix printing robot made with a LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3. It accepts any image file." 
---

This is a dot matrix printing robot that will accept any image file (including jpeg and png). Images around 80 pixels width look the best. At the moment, images that are RGB, and B&W can be automatically processed by the code.

The printer prints on US Letter paper (8.5"W X 11"H).  The whole printer is 29W X 24L X 21H once boxed up with LEGO plates (in LEGO stud measurement). The EV3 brick and one Medium Motor is on the side, outside the box.  

Equipment needed: 1 EV3 Brick running ev3dev, 2 Medium Motors, 1 Large Motor, 1 Color Sensor.  The color sensor is used to feed the paper up to a particular point.  It can also be used to reset the printer between different colors.  One Medium Motor controls the paper feeding mechanism.  The second Medium Motor moves the printer head left to right.  The Large Motor is used to move the pen up and down.
