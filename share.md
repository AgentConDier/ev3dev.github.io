ev3dev.org Projects Page
------------------------

We currently have a [projects page] where you can browse projects that have
been built using ev3dev. You can add your own too!  Each project gets a
dedicated page for the author to explain what they have been working on, as
well as provide videos, pictures, build instructions, code, and any other media
that pertains to the project.

All the projects on the website are stored in the [projects folder].
Each post is saved as a Markdown file, and is automagically converted to HTML
when you publish your changes. To submit a page,
all you need to do is add a markdown file in that folder and submit a pull
request. We recommend that you start with a copy of the [template project].
You can see the example file live on [the website][template page].

In case you need more detailed instructions, have a look at
[Adding a new project][] tutorial.
