          ev3dev is a <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian Linux</a> based
          operating system that runs on several LEGOⓇ MINDSTORMS compatible
          platforms including the <a href="http://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/products/31313-mindstorms-ev3">LEGOⓇ MINDSTORMS EV3</a>

          Just like you can take apart your LEGOⓇ models and build something
          completely different, we have reversed-engineered the EV3 and created
          a new software platform for programming your robots.

## <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-console heading-icon"></span> EV3 programming unlocked

ev3dev gives you the power to program how <i>you</i> want to. We have created
a system of hardware drivers for sensors, motors and everything else. It's as 
easy as reading from and writing to a file.

ev3dev supports many popular scripting languages out-of-the-box, so you can
get started right away.

## <i class="fa fa-linux"></i> Backed by the full power of Linux

Since ev3dev is built on Debian Linux, this means there are over 43000 free 
software packages available for you to install.

And with the Linux kernel at its core many USB and Bluetooth devices, like
Wi-Fi dongles, keyboards, keypads, joysticks and cameras work too.

## <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-save heading-icon"></span> It's not firmware

It's more like dual-boot. ev3dev runs from a microSD card and doesn't ever
touch the firmware installed on the EV3. To switch back, you just shut down
and remove the microSD card - no flashing required.
